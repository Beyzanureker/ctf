# Insecure Login Page – CTF Demo

This project is a **front-end based login page** created for **CTF-style security awareness and educational purposes**.  
It demonstrates how **client-side authentication alone is insecure** and should not be trusted in real-world applications.

## 🏁 How the Flag Was Found: Analyze the Page
- The homepage **does not include backend communication**, just look at the HTML code.
